# Release-Notes
I have extensive experience creating and publishing release notes for software products and internal platforms and tools.
This repository contains:
- A sample of release notes I wrote for a fictional wellness app, CalmPal, to demonstrate my ability to craft clear, user-focused content.
- Internal instructions I wrote for updating the external release notes page in Adobe Experience Manager.
